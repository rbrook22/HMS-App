## Team Strategy
<p>
Before project week officially kicked off, we already had an idea of what we wanted to complete. We wanted to build a web app that seemed feasible within the scope of time we had to complete it so ended up changing course with what our project would be. The day of official kick off we took the time to storyboard a few options for how we wanted the user to interact throughout the process and flow of the site. We then took these stories to build the structure of the site and its pages.

After reviewing the requirements of the project and coming up with an idea, the next steps were to come up with a plan. We spent the first day laying out our ideas across a whiteboard, sketched out wireframes and discussed the problems we were looking to solve. Ultimately we decided to go with bare bones on this project to keep scope of time in mind and just build out the site and render information based on user click. We also wanted this app to be web responsive, so we styled based on the ‘mobile first’ design.
